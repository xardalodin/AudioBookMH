# AudioBookMH
audiobookplayer

OLd VS2010 project to hijack the windows media player and add a better playlist to it for audioboks.
it remembers where you left off, even if computer restarts. 

for installation in windows it used visual studio installer, and now VS 2015 complains about it.
either find a way to install visualstudio installer or find another 3d party installer creator.
or if one exists in windows that does not require me to give money to microsoft to get through the smartscreen.

its the AudioBookMH_Setup project thats failing..

to do:
add more media players. 
fix add try catch for file access.. 
fix the AudioBookMH_Setup project (get new installer)
