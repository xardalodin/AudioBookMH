OLd VS2010 project to hijack the windows media player and add a better playlist to it for audioboks.
it remembers where you left off and even if computer restarts. 

for installation in windows it used visual studio installer, and now VS 2015 complains about it.
either find a way to install visualstudio installer or find another 3d party installer creator.
or if one exists in windows that does not require me to give money to microsoft to get through the smartscreen.

to do:
add more media players. 
fix add try catch for file access..
